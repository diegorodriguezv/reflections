When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    First as a backup in the cloud of my work (and the whole history of that work). Second,
    when collaborating with a team.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    The remote repository can be shared among a team and other developers can introduce
	changes incompatible with my current branch.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: When I want to create an independent copy of someone else's work.
	Clone: When I want to create a copy of my work or someone I work with.
	Branch: To create an experimental feature or fix a bug.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    The benefit is that you can do offline operations with that remote branch.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Probably by sending zip files with the entire project by email.
	Sharing is easy. Merging is hard. Besides it is super slow.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
