What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	You create the basic structure to hold the directory metadata.  

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	It represent a one time logical change to the working directory. It helps
	to prepare a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	By only staging the files related to that change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	By creating a branch for each environment of an application (production, 
	qa, staging, development). That way you can know which code version is running 
	in each environment.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	Nice. I mean yes. :)

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
	
	It's the union of the changes (commits) in both branches. We represent the merge 
	as a node with two or more parents because it is the union of the changes in all 
	branches.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

	Pros
		No work!		
	Cons
		What if it messes up? It won't! When it detects a conflict it asks.
		(So, no cons)
